# Shopping List

Grocery shopping sucks. Lucky for us we have a grocery list to keep track of ALL OF THE SNACKS we don't have yet but soon will.

## Specification

### Phase Zero

- Clone down this repository.

### Phase One

- When a user hits the submit button, both the item and the quantity should be displayed on the DOM.
Ie:  `1 Carrot`  
(or `Quantity: 1   Item: Carrot` if you feel like getting fancy.)
- The input field should be cleared out after the item has been successfully submitted.

### Phase Two

- The submit button should be disabled if there is no content in the input field.
- The submit button should be enabled if there is valid content in the input field.
- Each item should have a button that removes it from the page.

### Phase Three

- There is edit functionality
